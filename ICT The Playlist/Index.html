    <p id="p1">The first episode of “The Playlist” is about the perspective of the founder of Spotify Daniel Ek.
        <br>
    It goes through the hardships he went through his life in order to make Spotify possible. Going 
        <br>
    through negotiations with different record companies and failing to secure a deal repeatedly.

    <p id="p1">I like the style of storytelling they went with in which every episode is based on a 
        <br>
        different point of view of one of the individuals that played a role in making Spotify.

        Daniel Ek is portrayed as a young aspiring software engineer eager to make his <br>
        company Spotify work in the modern age with the changes of technology and culture seen in the <br>
        episode. Really shows how smart and innovative he is and how he does not give up easily when <br>
        faced with hardships.

    <p id="p1">
        It is very inspiring seeing someone go from having no job to being a multi-millionaire, we <br>
        could even say that he is a multi-billionaire. Thanks to his skills and smart thinking, he was able <br>
        to see the trends and problems happening in his time and how to also take advantage of them. <br>

        From what I can see now, Spotify really did its purpose of replacing and taking Piratebay <br>
        out of the picture. And to become the website a person would use when listening to music. <br>
        Because Piratebay currently is getting a fraction of the amount of traffic they used to get and <br>
        Spotify is now one of the largest music streaming services in the world.
    </p>
</div>

<div id="t7">
    <p id="p1">
        Spotify dominates the music industry in the current years, a far cry from having no music <br>
        label wanting to sign with them in order to stream their music to the wider public. Spotify is so <br>
        commonly used nowadays that even I use Spotify to listen to not only music but also podcasts, <br>
        I am using Spotify as I write this paper.

        In conclusion, this show really does teach us a lot of things. Like how the music industry <br>
        used to work and how it innovated from old times into the modern age, the characteristics of <br>
        Daniel Ek should also be one you should dream to achieve, not to mention the inner working of <br>
        Spotify mentioned in later episodes of the show teaches you how companies function. The story <br>
        is very engaging and is a good watch. I really like the show and will continue to watch it in the <br>
        future.
